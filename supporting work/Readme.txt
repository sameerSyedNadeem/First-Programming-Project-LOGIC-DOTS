These are the cards which came with the LogicDots which you used as hints to solve the puzzles.

We simplified the rules in such a way that you don't have to do a lot of text manipulation to parse these.
Unfortunately that has made the rules rather difficult to understand. So we have attached the original rules in the Bonus folder as is.
So if you want to parse board1-simple.txt just see the board1.txt file under the Bonus folder to get some clarity on what each of the rules are.

*some boards have been skipped because they required additional functions to be implemented and thus we have made them bonus. If someone wants to implement them they are free to do so.

Given a file similar to this to the GameSolver: return the final output board.
